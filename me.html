The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the southern bank of the 

river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the 

Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658) to house the tomb of 

his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan 

himself. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which 

includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on 

three sides by a crenellated wall.
